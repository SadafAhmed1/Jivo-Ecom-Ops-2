# Enhanced Terminal IDE - Full System Access Guide

## Overview

The Enhanced Terminal IDE provides complete system access through WebSocket connections, giving you a real terminal experience directly in the web interface. This replaces the limited Claude Code approach with a more powerful solution.

## Key Features

✅ **Full System Terminal Access** - Real shell with all commands available
✅ **WebSocket Connection** - Real-time terminal communication  
✅ **Internet Access** - Full network connectivity (curl, wget, ping, etc.)
✅ **File Explorer Integration** - VS Code-like file tree with clickable files
✅ **Tabbed Editor** - Open and view multiple files simultaneously
✅ **White Theme Interface** - Clean design matching the application style
✅ **Resizable Terminal** - Drag the top border to adjust terminal height
✅ **Connection Status** - Visual indicators for terminal connectivity

## How It Works

Unlike the previous Claude Code approach, this system:
- Connects to your actual system terminal through WebSocket
- Runs commands directly on the host system (not sandboxed)  
- Provides full internet access and network connectivity
- Features a clean white interface matching your application design
- Allows terminal height adjustment by dragging the resize handle
- Provides full access to file system, network, and system resources
- Maintains persistent terminal sessions

## Interface Features

**Clean Design**: White background with proper syntax highlighting for different message types:
- Input commands: Blue and bold
- System messages: Orange and italic
- Error messages: Red text
- Output: Standard gray text

**Resizable Terminal**: Drag the gray bar at the top of the terminal to adjust height (200-600px range)

**Connection Status**: Real-time status indicators showing terminal connectivity

### Common Commands & Use Cases

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Ask clear, specific questions about your code
2. **Context Matters**: Claude Code can see your entire codebase
3. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, testable changes
4. **Review Changes**: Always review Claude Code's suggestions before implementing
5. **Use Git**: Commit frequently when working with Claude Code

### Troubleshooting

If Claude Code isn't working:

1. **Check Installation**: `npm list @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
2. **Try Full Path**: `npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
3. **Check Internet**: Claude Code requires internet connectivity
4. **Verify Billing**: Ensure your Anthropic account has active billing

### Example Session

```bash
$ npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code
